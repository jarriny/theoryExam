# DFA Data Representation
# NFA Data Representation
The data definition of my DFA and NFA can be found at dfa.py and nfa.py
They are almost identical and both have fields for states, start, accept, transitions, and alphabet
All of the fields are sets to avoid multiple instances of something.
We also have a transitions class that has a field for q1, character, and q2. 

I spent 6-7 hours on this final. I had a rugby game that I came back home from and started working again, but was still not able to finish in the allotted time. I do not believe this final was fair. None of the questions themselves are terrible. But the professor knew that it takes people on average 8 hrs to do a hw every week, but made the exam the same length as a homework. It is kind of ridiculous. 

Other than that I hope you read my code and give some partial credit wherever possible.
Thanks
